## Description
This is a client-side blog post web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. All data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage, making it fully functional without a backend. The project also includes form validation, custom error handling, and dynamic DOM updates to provide a smooth, interactive experience.

## A reflection on development, challenges, and solution
Developing this simple blog post app was a valuable learning experience that deepened my understanding of core front-end development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage.

## Development Process
I began by building the basic structure using HTML and CSS to create a clean, responsive layout. Once the UI was in place, I used JavaScript to implement dynamic functionality â€” such as capturing user input, validating form data, and updating the DOM in real time. I chose to use the browser's localStorage to store blog posts.

## Challenges
Implementing the edit feature was tricky. I had to consider editing both the DOM and the localstorage and keep tracking. 
Another challenge was the custom validation. 

## Solution
I used event listeners and data attributes to track which post was being edited and to ensure accurate updates.
